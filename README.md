# Mowing modelling
Mowing modelling in Alpine's area from remote sensing images by machine learning algorithm

# Process
1. Download preprocess S1 tiled and S2 corrected images from PEPS
2. Compute vegetation indices from S2 images: vegindex.py
3. Compute the groundtruth from PNE shapefile: groundtruth.py
4. Create the dataset from all remote sensing images and groundtruth data
5. Launch the multimodal-temporal mowing predictor model learning: learning.py
6. Predict mowing from remote sensing images through the model: predict.py
